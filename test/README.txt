Predefined Identifiers
Predefined identifiers are declared in the predefined package STANDARD. An example of a predefined identifier is the exception INVALID_NUMBER.
For a list of predefined identifiers, use this query:
SELECT TYPE_NAME FROM ALL_TYPES WHERE PREDEFINED='YES';

V$RESERVED_WORDS
V$RESERVED_WORDS displays a list of all SQL keywords. To determine whether a particular keyword is reserved in any way, check the RESERVED, RES_TYPE, RES_ATTR, and RES_SEMI columns.
Column	Datatype	Description
KEYWORD	VARCHAR2(30)	Name of the keyword
LENGTH	NUMBER	Length of the keyword
RESERVED	VARCHAR2(1)	Indicates whether the keyword cannot be used as an identifier (Y) or whether the keyword is not reserved (N)
RES_TYPE	VARCHAR2(1)	Indicates whether the keyword cannot be used as a type name (Y) or whether the keyword is not reserved (N)
RES_ATTR	VARCHAR2(1)	Indicates whether the keyword cannot be used as an attribute name (Y) or whether the keyword is not reserved (N)
RES_SEMI	VARCHAR2(1)	Indicates whether the keyword is not allowed as an identifier in certain situations, such as in DML (Y) or whether the keyword is not reserved (N)
DUPLICATE	VARCHAR2(1)	Indicates whether the keyword is a duplicate of another keyword (Y) or whether the keyword is not a duplicate (N)
