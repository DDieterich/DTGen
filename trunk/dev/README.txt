   Developed by DMSTEX (http://dmstex.com)

Because DTGen is used to create DTGen, development is a little tricky.  Somehow, a current version of DTGen must be "morphed" into a newer version of DTGen.  This directory provides scripts to facilitate that morphing process.  The full procedure is decribed in the DTGen Wiki Page "https://code.google.com/p/dtgen/wiki/DTGenModificationProcedure"


Files and Directories:
----------------------
cleanup.sh          - Linux Script to remove new DTGen objects from database
d.env               - Defines environment variables
d.sh                - Main script that runs other scripts
                      Usage: d.sh (setup|test|cleanup|remove)
load.sh             - Loads the new DTGen environment
                      Runs Supplemental Scripts "fullgen" and "fullasm"
remove.sh           - Removes new DTGen logins
setup.sh            - Creates new DTGen logins
                      Runs Supplemental Scripts "create_owner"
