 = Global Deployment Options =
|| || *DB Integrity* || *Case Correction* ||
|| A || No || No ||
|| B || Yes || No ||
|| C || No || Yes ||
|| D || Yes || Yes ||

Note: All testing will occur with both Database server and Mid-Tier server configured and running allowing for all testing to occur on both Database server and Mid-Tier server.

Note: All testing will occur with a non-schema user loaded and running allowing for all testing to occur on both schema access and non-schema user access
