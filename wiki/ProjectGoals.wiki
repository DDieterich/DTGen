#summary Background and goals for the project

= Introduction =

Many hours of programming time are dedicated to tasks that are repeated on every project.  With regard to data and databases, several areas usually require effort to design and code:

  * Data history (audit trails, "undo", archiving, etc...)
  * Surrogate keys (very useful, but not intuitive to users)
  * Simple domain integrity (ex. "yes" or "no" without foreign key tables)
  * Multi-Tier deployment (data caching and integrity at the mid-tier)
  * Hierarchical data and paths (ex. manager to employee relationships)
  * Data maintenance forms (basic data query and modification)

There are many software generators available.  Oracle's own Data Modeler can generate data dictionary language (DDL) for the Oracle database.  However, the real strength of a generator comes from an ability to change for individual project or company needs, i.e. customized generation.  DTGen was created as a starting point for customized Oracle database software generation.

= Data History =

 * Tracking of what data was available when
 * Simple concept
 * Complicated by data entry errors
 * "Undo" is a modern expectation of data systems
 * Auditing implies tracking who changed the data
 * Auditing "Undo" is even more complicated
 * Reporting becomes very difficult
 * LOG tables do simple "when it happened" tracking
 * EFF tables allow historical entry of "when it happened"

= Surrogate Keys =

 * Natural keys are easier for the user to understand
 * Enable natural key changes without losing original record reference
 * A single number is simpler than multi-column natural keys
 * Can follow records from one database to another
 * More difficult for user to work with than natural keys
 * Transactional views allow natural key data manipulation of surrogate keys

= Simple Domain Integrity =

 * Any small, discrete data set that rarely changes
 * Examples are (Yes, No), (Male, Female), (Flag), Types of Things
 * Avoid using foreign key tables
 * Avoid overloading a single table of domain values
 * Automatically built into application as check constraints
