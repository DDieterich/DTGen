#summary Background and goals for the project

= Introduction =

Many hours of programming time are dedicated to tasks that are repeated on every project.  With regard to data and databases, several areas usually require effort to design and code:

  * Data history (audit trails, "undo", archiving, etc...)
  * Surrogate keys (very useful, but not intuitive to users)
  * Multi-Tier deployment (caching of data at the mid-tier)
  * Hierarchical data and paths (manager to employee relationships)
  * Data maintenance forms (basic data query and modification)

There are many software generators available.  Oracle's own Data Modeler can generate database
