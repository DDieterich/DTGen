#summary DTGen Functionality Overview.

= Introduction =

Given a basic entity-relational model and required model meta-data, DTGen generates Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, and APEX source code.  The input for DTGen is data saved to a DTGen schema in an Oracle database.  The data can be entered from a user built SQL*Loader Control file (an example is included) and/or the DTGen application in APEX.  The output from DTGen is line oriented text data stored in the same DTGen schema.  The text data can be queried from the DTGen schema and/or downloaded as a file via generated URLs in APEX. DTGen runs on [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/express-edition/overview/index.html Oracle's Free Database].  See [http://code.google.com/p/dtgen/wiki/Compatibility Compatibility] for more details on software versions.

== Augmented Schema Functionality ==

The transition from Entity/Relationship model to SQL schema requires some not-so-obvious functions that are typically provided by application developers.  Augmented schema functionality generates the needed SQL and PL/SQL source code to enable functions like update-able natural keys, case folding, and full path hierarchical data.  The following sections describe this augmented functionality in more detail.

=== Sequences and Surrogate Primary Keys (PK) ===

Much has been said about WWW about the use of surrogate keys.  However, it is a useful tool for allowing update-able natural keys.  It also works nicely for the ID of an instantiated object in Java.  All DML and queries on the schema generated with DTGen can be done using natural keys only.  The surrogate keys are completely automated and don't need to be used by an application.

=== Natural Key Update-able Views ===

This has always been a prime function issue with basic SQL schema.  If you need to update a natural key that is used as primary and foreign keys, there are some real hoops to jump through.  The use of surrogate keys allow the primary and foreign key values to remain unchanged as the natural keys change.  (NOTE: Changing natural keys can reek havoc on an application, use with care!)  Additionally, DTGen requires natural keys to be defined on each table and generates the needed PL/SQL and SQL to enforce a unique constraint on those keys.

=== Indexed Foreign Keys (FK) and Natural Keys (NK) ===

Once foreign keys and natural keys have been defined, DTGen automatically generates the SQL to create those indexes on those columns.

=== Custom Check Constraints ===

While this appears to be an ordinary function of the basic check constraint in the Oracle database, there is an architectural switch (glob.db_constraints) in the PL/SQL generated by DTGen that allows this enforcement to occur on the mid-tier, instead of the database.  This is part of the configurable mutl-tier deployment of the generated code.

=== Enforced Discrete Domains (no FK) ===

As with anything, enforced discrete domains is a mixed blessing.  These discrete domains allow simple domains to be defined and enforced without the need to additional tables or the need for a common "references" table that has all the problems of accurate integrity enforcement.  The down side of these discrete domains is that they are almost impossible to change on a deployed system because they are essentially "hard-coded" into the PL/SQL generated by DTGen.  These discrete domains are invaluable for things like Yes/No, but may not be appropriate for other domains that may change.

=== Enforced Case Folding ===

=== Full Procedural APIs for each Entity ===

=== Full Path Hierarchical Data (PK and NK) ===

== Cross-Cutting Concerns ==

=== Global Lock Helper Function for Single Threaded Logic ===

=== Global Logging Function using Autonomous Transaction ===

=== Entity Based History and Audit _(Note 1)_ ===

=== Point-in-Time *_ASOF_* Views _(Note 1)_ ===

=== Transportable *_ASOF_* Data _(Note 1)_ ===

=== Audited *_POP_* Functions _(Note 1)_ ===

==== Default Maintenance User Interface ====

=== Data Domain Filterable Grid Edit (APEX) ===

=== Generated PL/SQL for CLOB DML (APEX) ===

=== Comprehensive *_OMNI_* View Forms _(Note 1)_ ===

=== GUI Query-able *_ASOF_* and *_OMNI_* Reporting _(Note 1)_ ===

==== Configurable Multi-Tier Deployments ====

=== Optional Deployment to Multiple Mid-Tier (MT) Servers ===

=== Optional Deployment to Multiple Database (DB) Servers using Oracle RAC ===

=== Optional Disablement of DB Enforced Integrity Constraints (MT Enforcement) ===

=== Simultaneous Data Access from DB and MT Servers ===

=== Generated Materialized Views for MT Deployment of Selected Entities ===

_Note 1: These functions should be avoided due to the difficulty of maintaining foreign key transaction integrity until issue #2 is resolved._
