#summary Release Process
#labels Phase-ProjectManage

= Introduction =

The DTGen release is complicated by the fact that DTGen is used to generate DTGen. The starting point for this circular process is the scripts used to create DTGen in the database. Accordingly, the source for DTGen are these scripts.

The DTGen release process follows "Common Branching Patterns" best practices from "Version Control with Subversion" (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.html#svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns).

= SVN Version Information =

SQL*Developer 3.1.07 Uses SVN/Kit 1.3.2<br>
SVN/Kit 1.3.2 Uses SVN Client 1.6.2

Note: The latest TortoiseSVN Release uses SVN client 1.7<br>
SVN Client 1.7 is not compatible with SVN Client 1.6

TortoiseSVN with the last 1.6 SVN client (1.6.17) can be downloaded at<br>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/files/1.6.16/Application/

Subversion 1.6 compatability information can be found at<br>
http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.6.html

= DTGen Development/Modification =

Since DTGen generates DTGen, the development/modification of DTGen requires a more complicated procedure.  An example procedure can be found at [DTGenModificationProcedure DTGen Modification Procedure].
